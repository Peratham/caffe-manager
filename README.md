# caffe-manager

Few scripts to make simple to run experiments in caffe and organize the results.
The aim is to follow the patterns for research in machine learning written by John Langford in http://hunch.net/?p=2562 (e.g. recording the options that generated each experiment).

The main script is runExperiment. You can get help about its use and parameters by typing runExperiment -h
